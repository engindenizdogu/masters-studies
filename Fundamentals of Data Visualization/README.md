# Labs and Assignments
This repository contains ungraded labs and a final project related the Fundamentals of Data Visualization course for the Master of Science in Data Science program taught by University of Colorado, Boulder. Altair (Python) package was used to help with visualization tasks.

Learning objectives include:
- Identify different techniques for mapping data to visual elements.
- Describe trade-offs between different ways of mapping data to visual values.
- Detect common ineffective or misleading practices in visualizations.
- Create interactive visualizations in Altair.
- Design visualizations specifically tailored to a given problem and dataset.
- Work with stakeholders to determine how the visualizations can best suit their needs.
- Demonstrate how visualization design might influence subsequent actions beyond estimating statistical values.
- Choose between different methods for assessing the utility of a visualization (qualitative and quantitative studies)
- Identify the set of factors that are necessary to drive an experimental design.
