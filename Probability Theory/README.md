# Labs and Assignments
This repository contains problem sets and ungraded labs related to probability theory for the Master of Science in Data Science program taught by University of Colorado, Boulder. Each assignment focuses on specific topics and challenges related to computational complexity, correctness, and practical implementations. Assignments and labs are written in R.

## Topics Covered in Lab 1 & Assignment 1
- Axioms of probability
- Same birthday simulations
- Dice roll simulations

## Topics Covered in Lab 2 & Assignment 2
- Bayes' Theorem, Law of Total Probability
- Independent & conditional probability

## Topics Covered in Lab 3-4 & Assignment 3-4
- Discrete and continuous random variables (Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial, normal, uniform, poisson and exponential)
- Calculating probability density functions or cumulative distribution functions of random variables

## Topics Covered in Assignment 5
- The concept of joint distribution (multivariate cases)

## Topics Covered in Lab 5 & Assignment 6
- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and its applications such as characterizing the distribution of the mean and vairance of a large data set
